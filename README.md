# travelwithme
This project aims to build a web-based travel agency utilizing React.js for the front-end, Styled Components for styling, Yarn for managing dependencies, and Vite.js as the development server.

React.js is a JavaScript library that allows for creating reusable UI components and efficient data updates. Styled Components allow developers to use JavaScript functions and variables to define styles, and can be scoped to specific components. Yarn, a faster and more reliable package manager than npm, will be used to handle dependencies such as React, Styled Components, and Vite.js.
Vite.js as development server which is built on top of native ES modules, lightweight and provides instant feedback.

The website is expected to provide an interactive and visually appealing experience for users to browse and book travel packages. It could potentially include features such as:

A landing page for marketing and showcasing different packages
A catalog of destinations and packages
Search and filter options for packages
Package details and booking capabilities
User account management and booking history
Payment options
Reviews and ratings for packages.
The final features would depend on the specific requirements and scope of the project. The goal is to make the website easy to navigate and help users find and book their desired travel packages.
